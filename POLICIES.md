## Perfume Usage & Instructions

### APPLICATION
Increase/decrease the number of perfume sprays to adjust the intensity and longevity of the fragrance. **4-6 sprays** are recommended as an initial application. **1-2 sprays** to top up if needed.

**For best longevity, apply as follows:**
- Hold the spray pump approximately **3cm from the skin's surface** (the closer, the better)
- Spray the perfume in a single, concentrated spot about the size of a large coin onto the upper outside part of the forearm, where the skin is thicker and perfume binds best
- Avoid spraying perfume into the air unnecessarily—always aim carefully for your target area

**AVOID RUBBING** perfume after application. Rubbing more than doubles the surface area of evaporation, which in turn more than halves the perfume's longevity.

**Pro Tips:**
- Spraying on the inner, hidden surfaces of garments and your hair are excellent ways to enhance your perfume's longevity
- This also decreases risks of allergic reactions
- Inert objects retain the perfume's olfactive properties best

### MAINTENANCE
**To resolve blocked spray pumps:** Remove the nozzle portion and rinse with warm water (not all perfume ingredients evaporate fully and can form a soluble residue over time)

### STORAGE
- Store perfume **upright** to prevent any leaking
- Keep in a **cool, dark place** (light, oxygen, and heat will oxidize/damage your perfume over time)
- Always wipe any perfume residue from your bottle or any other surface after use with a damp cloth/tissue

### INGREDIENTS
Premium Parfum Essence | Ethanol (denat.) | Isopropyl Myristate | Aqua | Propylene Glycol | BHT | TBHQ

*Perpetual Linger reserves the right to alter perfume formulations to improve olfactive characteristics or to comply with industry best practices and relevant legislation.*

### ⚠️ WARNING
**Flammable contents**

- **DO NOT LEAVE A FULL PERFUME BOTTLE IN A CAR IN THE HOT SUN** – it will burst (perfumes have high expansion and evaporation rates when heated)
- Use of the product is at your own risk
- If sprayed into eyes, wash with running water immediately
- Do not ingest perfume
- Allergic reactions or skin irritations due to natural and synthetic ingredients found in perfume are possible but rare. Should this occur, discontinue use and wash the skin with soap and water
- Avoid the neck or torso where skin is more sensitive. Rather spray onto outer forearms where skin is tougher
- Due to the high ethanol content of perfumes, like most sanitizers, the ethanol destroys good and bad skin microbes. Alternate where you apply your perfume to avoid skin irritations over time
- Be careful not to spray the perfume directly onto outer garments—its solvent properties may cause temporary stains or affect the color pigments or fine materials of a garment
